%===============================================================

\begin{chapterabstract}
    Objective:
    This chapter analyzes the role and structure of university incubators and accelerators in supporting the commercialization of student-led game development projects, with a focus on the Czech Republic’s academic context.
    Context:
    While student game developers often excel at the creative and technical aspects of game creation, the transition from prototype to commercial product presents a host of challenges—ranging from legal and financial complexities to marketing and operational hurdles. Traditional commercialization support structures, such as general university incubators and accelerators, provide valuable resources but may not fully address the unique needs of game startups, which face distinct product life cycles, monetization models, and market dynamics. The chapter also explores legal, organizational, and partnership formats for supporting student ventures, highlighting both current limitations and emerging best practices.
    Action:
    Drawing on case studies, research, and practical examples, the chapter evaluates the effectiveness of existing support mechanisms, including incubator and accelerator programs, and proposes specialized approaches tailored to the game industry. It details the legal structures available for student ventures, partnership and employment options, and the potential benefits of dedicated game incubators. The chapter also reviews how incubator models can be adapted to foster entrepreneurship, protect intellectual property, and facilitate sustainable business growth for student-led teams.
    Results:
    Readers will gain a comprehensive understanding of the commercialization landscape for student-developed games, the advantages and constraints of various support models, and actionable insights into structuring effective incubator programs. The chapter provides a roadmap for universities and policymakers to enhance support for student entrepreneurship in game development, ultimately increasing the likelihood of successful market entry and long-term impact.
\end{chapterabstract}

The journey from developing a promising game prototype to achieving commercial success is fraught with challenges, especially for student-led teams. While universities increasingly recognize the value of supporting entrepreneurship, the unique demands of the game industry—rapid product cycles, specialized monetization strategies, and highly competitive markets—require more targeted support than what is typically offered by general incubator or accelerator programs367.
University incubators and accelerators have become vital tools for bridging the gap between academic innovation and market readiness. These programs provide student entrepreneurs with access to mentorship, legal and business guidance, co-working spaces, and sometimes financial resources, all aimed at nurturing early-stage ventures345. However, the traditional models often struggle to accommodate the specific needs of game startups, which must navigate complex issues such as intellectual property rights, platform-specific requirements, and the nuances of digital distribution6.
In the Czech Republic, as in many countries, the commercialization of student-developed games is further complicated by legal, financial, and organizational considerations. Students must choose appropriate business structures, secure funding, and comply with labor and tax regulations, all while maintaining creative momentum and technical excellence3. University incubators can play a critical role in this process, offering not only logistical and legal support but also pathways for shared ownership, profit distribution, and collaboration with industry partners.
This chapter explores the current landscape of commercialization support for student game developers, critically assessing the limitations of existing models and making the case for specialized incubators tailored to the game industry. By understanding the full spectrum of support options—from legal structures and partnership formats to employment and cooperative models—students, educators, and policymakers can better equip aspiring game developers to bring their creations to market. Ultimately, fostering a more robust and targeted support ecosystem will not only benefit individual ventures but also strengthen the broader innovation landscape within academia and beyond.

\section{Start-Up Incubators and Accelerators}
\paragraph{Start-up incubators} help develop and refine high-potential startup ideas. They usually operate locally and provide resources over a span of one to five years. Incubators tend to offer guidance on developing a product from an idea, on-demand co-working space, legal consultation, networking opportunities and mentorship.
\paragraph{Start-up accelerators} are short, intensive programmes for early- or mid-stage founders. Accelerators are more structured than incubators and outline specific steps to create a scalable business. They often have an alumni and investor network and offer funding in return for stake in the company. Participants usually go through intensive mentorship from industry leaders on fundraising, product development, and growth marketing

Both start-up incubators and accelerators are typically selective in who they allow into their programme. While incubators provide the learning environment and physical resources to help an idea succeed, accelerators compress years worth of learning and growth into the span of a few months.

\section{Incubator Structure Options}
\begin{note}
explain why focus on incubators
\end{note}
University incubators play a critical role in fostering student-led innovation, particularly in game development, where access to funding, mentorship, and infrastructure can make or break a startup.

Most university incubator programmes operate under the non-profit umbrella of their institutions. This framework limits their ability to make profit, but allows them to provide services such as mentorship, business guidance, co-working spaces, and financial assistance often free of charge. Their primary goal is not immediate profitability but rather fostering entrepreneurship. This makes them ideal support structures for student-led game development initiatives.

Additionally, university incubators can provide a legal structure, shielding students from personal liability and protecting themselves using agreements - defining acceptable use of facilities, university branding, and termination clauses for noncompliance. Incubators might also provide licensing to intellectual property created on university grounds - since it is common that educational institutions reserve such rights.

University incubator programmes sometimes do attempt to make returns through royalty agreements, equity ownership, or loans, however even big universities tend to struggle to reach a self-sustaining model. The majority of such programmes are therefore funded by their host institutions or through mixed sources including corporate sponsorship, public funds, economic, alumni donors and more.

\subsection{Student Partnership Formats}
One of the most common ways for universities to support student-led ventures is through structured partnerships. These partnerships might allow students to establish independent legal entities while receiving guidance and support from the incubator.

\subsubsection{Supporting a Student-Led Venture}
\label{sec:label-supporting-student-venture}
The incubator can support a student-led venture in multiple ways. The most common include:

\labelitemi \textbf{Loans} - financing provided by lending money to the venture with agreed-upon repayment terms and interest rates.

\labelitemi \textbf{Equity Investment} - the incubator can invest capital in exchange for equity ownership, gaining partial control or stake in the supported business. Some non-profit structures cannot operate business as a primary purpose, cannot engage in unlimited liability partnerships and need to have their business activity aligned with their defined purpose.

\labelitemi \textbf{Grants} - non-repayable financial assistance, commonly done by non-profits. Can lower a supporting company’s tax burden.

Students looking to commercialize their games often register as a business-conducting entity. The most common legal structures include:
\paragraph{OSVČ (Sole Proprietary)} - for ventures conducted individually. It requires no initial capital, can be created by filing a unified registration form and paying an administration fee of CZK 1000. Downside is that the individual is fully liable for all the debts and losses.
\paragraph{S.R.O. (Limited Liability Company)} - commonly used for small teams. A s.r.o. is legally more structured, provides liability protection but requires structured book-keeping. An s.r.o. can be created with an initial capital of at least 1 CZK by concluding a memorandum of association (notary approval usually costs under CZK 10000) and by paying the administrative fees (around CZK 2700 when done by a notary) to list the company in the commercial register.
\paragraph{Other} - A.S. (Joint-Stock Company) or Komanditní Společnost (Limited Partnership) are less common but viable for large projects seeking investment. Setting them up and adhering to the tax code is complex.

\subsubsection{Employing Students}
Some university incubators employ students, either directly or through subsidiary game development firms. Students are compensated for their contributions. This approach simplifies the process of providing resources and can be structured in different ways:
\paragraph{Standard employment contracts} - student developers are paid a stable salary. The employer is generally required to contribute 33.8\% of an employee’s salary (2.1\% towards sickness insurance, 21.5\% towards pension insurance, 1.2\% towards state employment policy and 9\% towards health insurance) and the employee an additional 6.5\% to social-security, 4.5\% towards health insurance and pay a basic income tax of 15 %.
\paragraph{Freelance/contractor agreements} - students work as independent contractors. They are required to register as OSVČ and pay a 15\% income tax, social-security - 29.2\% of their income after expenses if their yearly profits exceed CZK 111736 (current for 2025) - and health insurance contributions - 13.5\% of their income after expenses.
\paragraph{Internship programmes} - students gain hands-on experience while benefiting from university-funded or industry-sponsored scholarships. Such programmes need to be part of the curriculum to comply with Czech labour laws.

\subsubsection{Allowing a Form of Ownership in the Incubator}
In some cases, student developers can have a stake in the incubator or its affiliated entities. This approach can minimize tax-burden and incentivize effort. It is most commonly done through:
\paragraph{Paying out dividends} - profits generated by the incubator or its spin-off companies are distributed among the owners through dividends. Such an approach requires the correct legal structure (commonly an a.s., but can also be done through an s.r.o.) and has to be contractually defined. Transferring shares involves a CZK 2000 administrative fee. Corporate profits are taxed 21\% and the dividends an additional 15\%.
\paragraph{Profit distribution} - a cooperative (družstvo in the Czech Republic) allows students to participate in the decisions of the incubator and share in the financial success. 10\% of the profits need to be kept in a fund, the rest is taxed 21\% and can then be distributed among the members (15\% income tax applies). Drafting the cooperative's statutes and certifying the founding meeting by a notarial deed usually costs around CZK 3000 CZK and CZK 10000 respectively. To list the company in the commercial register an administrative fee of CZK 2700 needs to be paid.

\subsection{Incubator Legal Structure}
University incubators in the Czech Republic can take on various legal structures, each offering unique advantages and constraints.

\subsubsection{Non-Profit Integration}
Many university incubators are structured as non-profit entities and integrated into the University's body. They are allowed to receive funding from public and private sources but focus on student development rather than profit-making. Common non-profit structures include:
\paragraph{Student Clubs or Organizations} - informal collectives within universities usually offering peer-to-peer support and networking. The operations of these collectives must strictly adhere to university policies and governance.
\paragraph{Joint Ventures with Private Companies} - often referred to as Public-Private Partnerships are not a legally described structure in the Czech Republic. Universities may partner with established game studios or tech firms to provide the required services.
\paragraph{Non-Profit Organizations} - more formalized structures capable of applying for public grants and private donations not allowed to be run for the sole purpose of generating profit.

% \begin{enumerate}
\labelitemi \textbf{Foundation (Nadace)} manages assets (exempt from tax) for charitable, religious, or public benefit goals. It is established by a notarial deed with an initial endowment (no minimal amount is specified) and by being listed in the foundations register. The endowment is usually protected and only earnings generated by its activities are expended. A foundation has to disclose annual financial reports and undergo audits. It is also restricted from participating in unlimited liability partnerships.

\labelitemi \textbf{Fund (Nadační fond)} is similar to a foundation but provides access to the entire endowment. Focuses on fundraising for specific causes or a time-bound project. A fund is registered by a notarial deed and by formulating governing statutes. No minimum capital is required. A fund undergoes lighter oversight than a foundation but is still required to disclose its activity.

\labelitemi \textbf{Registered Institute (Ústav)} conducts educational, scientific, or cultural activities. It is established by concluding a memorandum of association and registered in the commercial register and has to undergo annual audits if revenue exceeds CZK 40 million. Entrepreneurial activities must only be supportive in pursuing the institute’s purpose.

\subsubsection{University-Owned Spin-Off Companies}
Some universities establish legally separate entities capable of generating financial gains. These gains need to be distributed among the students to maintain the university’s nonprofit status. Common formats include:
\paragraph{S.R.O. (Limited Liability Company)} - a university-owned company that partners with student teams created following the points mentioned in section~\ref{sec:label-supporting-student-venture}.
\paragraph{A.S. (Joint-Stock Company)} - requires initial capital of at least CZK~2 million. This model is suitable for larger ventures seeking external investment.
\paragraph{Cooperative Structure} - a collective ownership model where students, faculty, and external partners share decision-making and profits. The association (spolek in the Czech Republic) is a non-commercial corporate entity - it is permitted to engage in both mutual benefit and public benefit activities, but must not be established for entrepreneurial activities.  A cooperative (družstvo in the Czech Republic) is a corporate entity requiring a minimum of 3 members. It is founded by concluding a memorandum of association (notary approval usually costs under CZK 10000) and by paying the administrative fees (usually around CZK 2700 when done by a notary) to list the company in the commercial register. Profit distribution rules are outlined in the cooperative’s memorandum and can include criteria beyond capital contributions (such as performance of specific segments). Distributed profits are subject to a 21\% corporate tax and a 15\% personal income tax.

\ctufitabstractCZE{Tato práce zkoumá, proč jsou studentské hry vytvořené na FITu po dokončení často opuštěny, a navrhuje možné řešení. Přestože v Praze roste soukromé investování, studentské podnikání zůstává nízké—mimo jiné kvůli absenci institucionálních mechanismů podporujících komercializaci studentských projektů. Navrhuji systém, který podpoří další rozvoj a případný vstup studentských her na trh. V rámci výzkumu se věnuji procesu vývoje her, příkladům institucionální podpory v zahraničí a možným cestám ke komercializaci. Na základě těchto poznatků předkládám rámec založený na družstevním modelu přizpůsobený potřebám studentů. Součástí práce bylo spuštění náborového webu, sběr kontaktů a zpětné vazby od potenciálních účastníků a návrh testovacího mechanismu. Přestože právní subjekt zatím nevznikl, součástí jsou stanovy a průvodce založení. Práce tak vytváří základ pro udržitelnou podpůrnou strukturu, která může studentům umožnit rozvíjet podnikatelský potenciál jejich kreativních projektů.}
\ctufitabstractENG{This thesis explores why student-created games at FIT are often abandoned after completion and proposes a solution. Despite increasing private investment in Prague, student entrepreneurship remains low—partly due to the lack of institutional mechanisms supporting the commercialization of student projects. I propose a system that encourages further development and potential market entry of student-made games. In the research I examine the game development process, examples of institutional support elsewhere, and possible commercialization pathways. Based on these insights I present a lightweight cooperative-based framework tailored to students’ needs. As part of the thesis, I launched a recruitment website, started collecting contacts and feedback from potential participants, and designed a testing mechanism. While no legal entity was established, statutes and a funding guide are provided. Ultimately, the work lays a foundation for a sustainable support structure that can empower students to pursue the entrepreneurial potential of their creative projects.}

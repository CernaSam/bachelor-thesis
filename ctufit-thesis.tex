\ctufitabstractCZE{V této práci zkoumáme, proč jsou studentské herní projekty na naší fakultě po dokončení často opuštěny a navrhujeme podpůrný systém, který podporuje jejich další rozvoj a možnou komercializaci. Přestože v Praze roste soukromé investování, studentské podnikání zůstává na nízké úrovni. Na naší fakultě chybí mechanismus, který by komercializaci her systematicky podporoval. Zaměřujeme se na proces vývoje her, existující podporu v jiných prostředích a~možné modely komercializace. Na základě této analýzy jsme navrhli systém s družstvem, přizpůsobený potřebám studentů. V rámci práce jsme spustili náborový web, získali více než tucet kontaktů od zájemců o zapojení, vytvořili stanovy družstva a připravili testovací mechanismus. Přestože nebyla založena žádná právnická osoba, práce pokládá základy pro udržitelnou podpůrnou strukturu, která může studenty motivovat a podpořit při využití podnikatelského potenciálu jejich kreativních projektů.}
\ctufitabstractENG{In the thesis we explore why student-created games at our faculty are often abandoned after completion. We design a support system that encourages further development and potential commercialization of these projects. Although private investment is rising in Prague, student entrepreneurship remains low. Our faculty lacks a mechanism to support game commercialization. We examine the game development process, existing institutional support elsewhere, and possible commercialization models, ultimately proposing a lightweight cooperative-based system tailored to students’ needs. As part of the thesis, we launched a recruitment website, collected over a dozen contacts from interested participants, developed association rules, and prepared a testing mechanism. While no legal entity was established, this thesis lays the groundwork for a sustainable support structure that can empower students to pursue the entrepreneurial potential of their creative projects.}
